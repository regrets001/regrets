   - `photo3.jpg` - Igatpuri - where magic happened
   - `photo4.jpg` - Her beautiful smile
   - `photo5.jpg` - You both being silly together

2. **Photo requirements:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WEBP
   - Size: Recommended 800x800px or larger (square format works best)

3. **To add more photos:**
   - Add more photos to this folder (photo7.jpg, photo8.jpg, etc.)
   - Edit the `goodbye.html` file and add more photo-frame divs
   - Update the captions to match your memories

4. **Photo captions:**
